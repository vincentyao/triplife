《时光里的未赴之约》​
​
你是否曾在某个暮色四合的傍晚，望着天边流云忽然想起 —— 那年在笔记本上画下的青海湖涟漪，夹在书页间泛黄的稻城亚丁攻略，或是和朋友酒后勾肩许下的 “明年去看极光” 的约定？时光像握不住的沙，那些曾在心底激起浪花的远方，是否正随着日子的翻页渐渐模糊了轮廓？​
我们总在等一个 “合适的时机”，却忘了有些心动本就该被小心收藏。这个小工具像一支温柔的笔，让你在匆匆岁月里停一停，把想去的地方轻轻写进云端：是京都落樱时节的茶寮，还是冰岛苔原上的极光观测站？不必担心它会迷失在记忆的褶皱里，所有未赴的约都在这里静静候着，等着某一天你翻开它，像拆开一封写给自己的旧信。​
当你在某个闲暇的午后点开它，指尖划过那些带着温度的名字，命运般随机选中一个地方 —— 仿佛时光在说：“就是此刻了。” 你可以记录下出发的日期、同行人的笑脸、途中偶然遇见的彩虹，或是某个让你眼眶发热的瞬间。那些曾在想象中徘徊的远方，终将在你的故事里落地生根，而这个小工具，会替你记得每一次心跳加速的 “我想去”。​
它不是冰冷的备忘录，而是藏在口袋里的时光胶囊。那些被你小心收进胶囊的远方，终会在某个合适的日子，变成脚下的路、眼中的景、回忆里的星光。毕竟，这世间最遗憾的不是 “没到达”，而是 “已遗忘”—— 而它，让所有的心动，都有了等待绽放的勇气。

Do you ever look up at the evening sky and suddenly remember old travel plans? Like that drawing of Qinghai Lake, that unused travel guide, or that promise you made with friends to see the Northern Lights "next year"?
Time flies, and it's easy for those travel dreams to fade away.
We keep waiting for the "right moment," but maybe we should just save those ideas we get excited about. This simple tool helps you do that. Just pause and quickly save the places you dream of visiting – whether it's seeing cherry blossoms in Kyoto or the Northern Lights in Iceland.
Think of it as saving your travel wishes safely in the cloud, so they don't get forgotten. They'll be waiting for you, like finding an old note you wrote to yourself.
Later, when you have a free moment, you can open it up and browse through your saved places. You could even let it pick one randomly, like a little nudge saying, "How about now?" Then, when you actually go, you can add your travel dates, photos of friends, cool things you saw (like a rainbow!), or any special memory. The places you dreamed about become real experiences. This tool helps you keep track of every "I really want to go!" moment.
It’s more than just a list; it's like a personal time capsule for your travel dreams. The places you save today can become the trips you take tomorrow – the paths you walk, the views you see, the memories you make.
Because the saddest thing isn't failing to reach a destination, it's forgetting you ever dreamed of it. This tool helps make sure your travel dreams get their chance.
